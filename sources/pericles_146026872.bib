abstract = {The primary aim of this computational study was to investigate the effect of positioning the ball so that contact between clubhead and ball takes place at the point in the downswing where the clubhead achieves its maximum horizontal component of velocity. The double pendulum model of the downswing was employed and computational results were obtained for a range of ‘release angles’ (the release angle determines the stage in the downswing at which the wrist joint is allowed to turn freely). The position of the wrist joint and the direction of motion of the clubhead at the instant at which the clubhead makes contact with the ball were also determined. Furthermore, clubhead velocity was found to increase if the release is delayed (the so-called ‘late hit’). The energy supplied by the golfer was also investigated and, in particular, its variation with release angle is studied. Using a detailed perturbation analysis of the equations of motion, the results show that for a swing using a ‘natural release,’ the energy supplied by the golfer was a minimum.},
