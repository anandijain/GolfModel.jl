# MATH2A (contrary to popular belief)

Golf project plan:

1) single unforced pendulum with point mass 
    - todo: add coupling to ball collision, momentum transfer
    - todo: fix all of the parameters, but especiial the moment of inertia, as we treat the club as a point mass
2) single forced pendulum 
    - this mimics the shoulder adding a constant force to the swing 
3) double pendulum
